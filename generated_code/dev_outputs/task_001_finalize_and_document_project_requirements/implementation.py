Of course. As a Senior Full-Stack Software Developer AI Agent, I will now produce the required artifacts for the "Finalize and Document Project Requirements" task.

This task is foundational. While it primarily involves documentation and stakeholder alignment, a senior developer's role is to translate these requirements into a tangible technical blueprint and initial project structure. Therefore, my response will consist of two main parts:

1.  **The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document**: This is the primary deliverable for this task, formatted as a comprehensive markdown document. It captures the functional and non-functional requirements as if they have been finalized with stakeholders.
2.  **The Initial Project Scaffolding**: To satisfy the "Complete Production Implementation" requirement, I will create the initial, production-ready project structure based on the SRS. This includes a backend microservice (Users Service) with full configuration, containerization, CI/CD pipeline, and database setup. This scaffolding serves as the immediate, deployable foundation upon which all features defined in the SRS will be built.

## Architecture & Technology Stack Selection

Based on the requirements for a modern, scalable e-commerce platform, I have selected the following technology stack:

*   **Backend**: Python with **FastAPI** for its high performance, asynchronous capabilities, and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
*   **Database**: **PostgreSQL** for its robustness, reliability, and rich feature set for relational data. **Alembic** will be used for database migrations.
*   **Caching**: **Redis** for session management, caching frequently accessed data, and potentially for task queues.
*   **Frontend (assumed for architecture)**: **React/TypeScript** (While not implemented in this task, the backend will be designed to serve a modern SPA).
*   **Containerization**: **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for creating reproducible development and production environments.
*   **CI/CD**: **GitHub Actions** for automated testing and linting.
*   **Architecture Pattern**: **Microservices**. We will start by scaffolding the `Users` service, which is a critical and foundational component. Other services like `Products`, `Orders`, and `Payments` would follow a similar pattern.

## 1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - E-commerce MVP

### 1.1. Introduction

**1.1.1. Purpose**
This document specifies the software requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the new E-commerce Platform. It serves as the single source of truth for all stakeholders, including product owners, developers, and QA engineers, ensuring a shared understanding of the project's scope, features, and constraints.

**1.1.2. Scope**
The MVP will focus on core e-commerce functionalities: user authentication, product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, a secure checkout process, and basic order history. The platform will be a web-based application designed for modern browsers on desktop and mobile devices.

**1.1.3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations**
*   **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
*   **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product
*   **API**: Application Programming Interface
*   **JWT**: JSON Web Token
*   **PWA**: Progressive Web App
*   **NFR**: Non-Functional Requirement

### 1.2. Overall Description

**1.2.1. Product Perspective**
The platform is a new, standalone e-commerce system designed to replace legacy solutions. It will be built on a modern, scalable microservices architecture to allow for future growth and feature expansion.

**1.2.2. User Classes and Characteristics**
*   **Guest/Anonymous User**: Can browse products and categories but cannot make a purchase.
*   **Registered Customer**: Can manage their profile, view order history, save addresses, and complete purchases.
*   **Administrator**: Can manage products, users, orders, and site content (out of scope for MVP, to be managed via a separate admin interface or direct database access initially).

**1.2.3. Operating Environment**
The system will be a cloud-native application deployed on AWS using Docker containers, orchestrated by Kubernetes for scalability and high availability. It will rely on PostgreSQL for data persistence and Redis for caching.

### 1.3. Functional Requirements (MVP)

#### FR-1: User Account Management
*   **FR-1.1**: As a new user, I want to sign up for an account using my email and a password so that I can make purchases.
*   **FR-1.2**: As a registered user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my profile and order history.
*   **FR-1.3**: As a logged-in user, I want to log out of my account to secure my session.
*   **FR-1.4**: As a logged-in user, I want to view and update my profile information (name, email). Password changes will be supported.
*   **FR-1.5**: As a logged-in user, I want to manage my shipping addresses.

#### FR-2: Product Catalog & Discovery
*   **FR-2.1**: As any user, I want to view a paginated list of all available products.
*   **FR-2.2**: As any user, I want to view the details of a single product, including its name, description, price, and images.
*   **FR-2.3**: As any user, I want to search for products by name or description.
*   **FR-2.4**: As any user, I want to filter products by category.

#### FR-3: Shopping Cart
*   **FR-3.1**: As any user, I want to add a product to my shopping cart.
*   **FR-3.2**: As any user, I want to view the contents of my shopping cart, including all items, quantities, and the total price.
*   **FR-3.3**: As any user, I want to update the quantity of an item in my cart.
*   **FR-3.4**: As any user, I want to remove an item from my cart.

#### FR-4: Checkout & Payments
*   **FR-4.1**: As a logged-in user, I want to proceed to a checkout page from my cart.
*   **FR-4.2**: As a user in checkout, I want to select a shipping address from my saved addresses or add a new one.
*   **FR-4.3**: As a user in checkout, I want to enter my payment information (credit card) securely. (Integration with a third-party payment provider like Stripe is required).
*   **FR-4.4**: As a user, I want to review my order (items, shipping, total cost) before confirming the purchase.
*   **FR-4.5**: As a user, I want to receive an order confirmation via email after a successful purchase.

#### FR-5: Order Management
*   **FR-5.1**: As a logged-in user, I want to view a list of my past orders.
*   **FR-5.2**: As a logged-in user, I want to view the details of a specific past order, including items purchased, shipping address, and order status (e.g., "Processing," "Shipped").

### 1.4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*   **NFR-1: Performance**
    *   API response times for 95% of requests must be under 200ms.
    *   Page load time for key pages (Homepage, Product Detail) should be under 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
    *   The system must support 1,000 concurrent users during the MVP phase.
*   **NFR-2: Scalability**
    *   The architecture must be horizontally scalable. Services should be stateless to allow for easy addition of new instances.
*   **NFR-3: Availability**
    *   The platform must have 99.9% uptime, excluding planned maintenance windows.
    *   The system must include health check endpoints for monitoring by orchestration tools.
*   **NFR-4: Security**
    *   All communication between the client and server must be encrypted using TLS 1.2+.
    *   Passwords must be hashed using a strong, salted algorithm (e.g., Argon2 or bcrypt).
    *   The system must be protected against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10), including SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.
    *   Authentication will be handled via JWTs with short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens.
    *   API endpoints must be protected with proper authorization checks.
*   **NFR-5: Maintainability**
    *   Code must adhere to PEP 8 standards for Python.
    *   All public API endpoints must be documented via OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
    *   The codebase must have a minimum of 80% unit test coverage.
*   **NFR-6: Data Integrity**
    *   All transactions (e.g., order placement, inventory update) must be atomic and consistent. Database transactions must be used to ensure data integrity.

    cp services/users_service/.env.example services/users_service/.env
    ```
    *It is highly recommended to change `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` for any real deployment.*

3.  **Build and Run Services:**
    Use Docker Compose to build the images and start the containers.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The Users API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`.

### 3.3. Database Migrations
Once the services are running, you need to apply the initial database migrations.

1.  **Generate Initial Migration (if not present):**
    Open a new terminal and run the following command to enter the `users_api` container.
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec users_api bash
    ```
    Inside the container, run alembic to autogenerate a migration script based on your models.
    ```bash
    # Inside the container
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration for users table"
    ```

2.  **Apply Migrations:**
    Run the upgrade command to apply all pending migrations to the database.
    ```bash
    # Inside the container
    alembic upgrade head
    ```
    Exit the container by typing `exit`.

### 3.4. API Documentation
With the service running, the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is automatically generated by FastAPI and is available at:
`http://localhost:8001/docs`

Alternative documentation (ReDoc) is available at:
`http://localhost:8001/redoc`

### 3.5. Running Tests
To run the test suite locally:
```bash
docker-compose exec users_api pytest
```

### 3.6. Deployment to Production
*   **Container Registry**: Push the built Docker image to a container registry like AWS ECR, Docker Hub, or Google Container Registry.
*   **Infrastructure**: Use Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) to provision a production environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS). This would include a Kubernetes cluster (EKS), a managed PostgreSQL instance (RDS), and a managed Redis instance (ElastiCache).
*   **CI/CD**: The provided GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) should be expanded into a CD (Continuous Deployment) pipeline that automatically deploys the new image to the Kubernetes cluster upon a successful merge to the `main` branch.
*   **Configuration**: Production environment variables (database credentials, secret keys) must be managed securely using a secret management tool like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault, and injected into the containers at runtime.
